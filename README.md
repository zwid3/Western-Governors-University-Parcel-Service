# Western-Governors-University-Parcel-Service
Optimized WGUPS delivery system ensuring efficiency, tracking, and deadline compliance.

## I developed an optimized delivery route program for the **Western Governors University Parcel Service (WGUPS)** to improve the efficiency of their daily local deliveries (DLD). The system ensures that all 40 packages assigned to the **Salt Lake City DLD route** are delivered on time while adhering to specific package requirements and keeping the total combined distance traveled by three trucks under 140 miles.  

### **Key Features of My Program:**  
- **Route Optimization Algorithm:** Designed and implemented an algorithm to determine the most efficient delivery sequence for all packages.  
- **Real-Time Tracking:** Allows supervisors to monitor truck progress, including package status, delivery times, and assigned truck details.  
- **Delivery Constraints Handling:** Ensures compliance with package-specific deadlines, required delivery conditions, and location dependencies.  
- **Scalability:** The solution is adaptable for implementation in other cities where WGU operates.  
- **Detailed Code Documentation:** Includes clear comments explaining logic, algorithm choices, and system behavior for ease of maintenance.
